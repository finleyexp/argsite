### ArgSite Usage
ArgSite, ArgNote, and ArgPir8s are the intellectual property of Monique Finley. They've been created for use with [the PuShing BhuTons Series](https://www.pushingbhutons.com) and [Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret](https://github.com/pushingbhutons/zeemz-ann). The ArgNote is a digital tradeable token that utilizes open source technology to facilitate the trade of in-game and in-novel assets, including the Argnote itself. 

Note: players do not own ArgNotes, they own ArgNote addresses and those address holders have the right to buy, sell, or trade ArgNotes and ArgNote compatible assets (ex. ERC-721X assets) on the ArgSite.

## Copyright Takedown Policy
If you find an image on our site that you own the copyright of and that you have not granted public commercial rights to, then please start a Pull Request with #DCMA-Takedown-Request in the Title and a link to the image in question. The ArgNote development team addresses all issues as quickly as an overtaxed two-person team is capable of addressing issues. That said, expect at least two weeks before we'll be able to begin the DCMA investigation.
